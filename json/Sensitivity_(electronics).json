{"cursor":"3013","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'sensitivity' of an electronic device, such as a communications system\nreceiver, or detection device, such as a PIN diode, is the minimum magnitude of\ninput signal required to produce a specified output signal having a specified\nsignal-to-noise ratio, or other specified criteria.\n\nSensitivity is sometimes improperly used as a synonym for [[responsivity]].\n\n; Microphones\n: The sensitivity of a microphone is usually expressed as the sound field\n: strength in decibels (dB) relative to 1 V/Pa (Pa = N/m 2) or as the\n: transfer factor in millivolts per pascal (mV/Pa) into an open circuit or into\n: a 1 kilohm load.\n; Loudspeakers\n: The sensitivity of a loudspeaker is usually expressed as dB / 2.83\n: V RMS at 1 metre. This is not the same as the electrical efficiency;\n: see Efficiency vs Sensitivity.\n; Hydrophones\n: The sensitivity of a hydrophone is usually expressed as dB re 1 V/µPa.\n\nSensitivity in a receiver is normally defined as the minimum input signal\nS_i required to produce a specified signal-to-noise S/N ratio at\nthe output port of the receiver and is defined as the mean noise power at the\ninput port of the receiver times the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio at\nthe output of the receiver:\n\n: S_i = k(T_a+T_{rx})B{\\cdot}\\frac{S_o}{N_o}\n\nwhere\n: S_i = sensitivity [W]\n:k = Boltzmann's constant\n: T_a = equivalent noise temperature in [K] of the source (e.g.\n:antenna) at the input of the receiver T_{rx} = equivalent noise\n:temperature in [K] of the receiver referred to the input of the receiver\n:B = bandwidth [Hz]\n: \\frac{S_o}{N_o} = Required SNR at output [-]\n\nBecause receive sensitivity indicates how faint an input signal can be to be\nsuccessfully received by the receiver, the lower power level, the better. Lower\npower for a given S/N ratio means better sensitivity since the receiver's\ncontribution is smaller. When the power is expressed in dBm the larger the\nabsolute value of the negative number, the better the receive sensitivity. For\nexample, a receiver sensitivity of -98 dBm is better than a receive\nsensitivity of -95 dBm by 3 dB, or a factor of two. In other words, at\na specified data rate, a receiver with a -98 dBm sensitivity can hear\nsignals that are half the power of those heard by a receiver with a -95 dBm\nreceiver sensitivity.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Sensitivity_(electronics)","recorded":1362482518,"links":17,"instances":["mathematics","unit","telecommunication","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronics terminology"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/3/57322f88a90b4fc9a5da1f5d01a8f6ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/0/1d06b444043d2c727b0f303331adc18a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/3/57322f88a90b4fc9a5da1f5d01a8f6ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/d/73dbbadc957c0a6b4dad293229e4bca1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/e/a9e184dea1857d7de8d7b4a74c2da4aa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/e/15e4c95bf061c55cec15c5e6221799ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["magnitude","mathematics"],["signalling","telecommunication"],["pascal","unit"],["newton","unit"],["pascal","unit"]],"members":["magnitude","newton","signalling","pascal"],"related":["Communications_system","PIN_diode","Magnitude_(mathematics)","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Microphone","Microphone","Sound","Field_strength","Decibel","Volt","Pascal_(unit)","Newton_(unit)","Meter","Pascal_(unit)","Open_circuit","Load_impedance","Loudspeaker","Loudspeaker","Electrical_efficiency","Hydrophone","Hydrophone","Boltzmann's_constant","Equivalent_noise_temperature","DBm"]}
